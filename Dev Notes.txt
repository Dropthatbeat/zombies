- Need to fix anything with comments
- need easter egg created
- need objectives completed
- pack a punch: no longer carries between buying a new hero
- achivements
- 4 perks max until downed with a hud icon for each perk
- firesale (all mystery box locations active at once, and only cost 10 points to buy new hero)
- buying same hero again for ammo cost half the amount, and pack a punch'd hero's cost more with a small message that tells the player how much their ammo costs
- buying the ending lets you start the game with pack a punch with what ever hero you beat the game with.
- pathfinding system

hero buy locations need to carefully demonstrate that the player is able to buy a follower or that same hero for themselves.

perk buy doesnt work
lots of in world text appear during starting screen
followers ult and attack without targets
followers get dropped when hero switching (crouch and F)
followers count as players during solo play (make it so if the player goes downed they lose their follower)
melee sometimes double swings - need to just do "damage(victim) when "is meleeing" to remove the delay
somehow managed to get negative points (probably bastion trap)
followers have global.T 0 (need global.T 1)
player can exit spawn during setup phase (set teleport away from spawns to only work with global.start 1)
some followers get stuck in ult animation (lucio and more)

perks showing without connecting power

buying a door didnt buy it (might be due to follower system activating first when it shouldnt happen at all)

some effects dont load in (needs a simple optimized way of designing each zones effects)

hero ability "reloads" dont work properly, like cassidy roll doesnt remove .5 magazines

door effects dont delete when purchased

make sure door system doesnt effect followers

wall positions arent right size or spot

challenge waves dont seem to activate consistantly and seem to last more than 1 wave

need to set it so walls have a condition for if is not(!) dummy bot

set points to scale with a chase variable, might need a 2nd rule that chases, while the main give points rule modifies a first variable(or index), and the 2nd variable would just be a visual

bots spawning inside either team 1 or 2's spawn room

need to remove effect on player that died and wasnt revived like pack a punch or anything else attached

let followers have pack a punch too, when holding reload over pack a punch

revive might be good to have it so players revive circle dissapears after enough time

need to use data compression for arrays, and set it up so that it works well with soft restart

maybe include a toggle some how to show third person - but make sure its accurate to crosshair -- maybe holding melee for x time 

set connect power to only spawn in player zone that they are currently in

a menu while playing?

add in a hud to show what your stats are when playing in XP mode. and show Hud when player is holding jump
- defence, attack, speed, health, clip size, max magazines, max number of ultimates,

make sure followers dont use any of the player variables and waste resources

maybe introduce workshop inspector tools to use while hosting the server afk in spectator. and collect analytics over what players do.
==potential things to store==
- what perks are bought the most often
- how many doors are bought per game
- how often are objectives used
- how often do players win
- how often do players play each role (tank support dps)
- how often someone is afk and gets auto kicked
- average play time
- success rate against boss's 
- how often  each gamemode settings and Difficulty are used
- how many new games have started
- average duration of a round (till soft restart and new round)
- highest round achieved
- average round achieved
- how often easter egg completed
- what round most often lost at or players most often leave at
-
== set all this to be only shown for host player in spectator == 
== server can only last for 4 hours 30 minutes, restarting game resets this timer. - need to gather data for 4 hours then output to inspector, then restart server after 4 hours 15 minutes ==

introduce an auto afk kick system

need to design the soft restart system to function right
- stores what heroes they bought that game
- resets doors and removes all perks and effects on player
- manages time properly with rule(Time manager)


- need to introduce a perk machine that gives a random perk with icon similar to new mystery box

- need to introduce better caption system

Difficulty settings
- modify all "workshop setting" settings, and remove them from their respective page, then have it so that easy normal and hard get their respective features

    - EASY 
- have armor system - armor breaks slowly
- slow bot reaction time
- dont randomize array for hero buy, and perks
- player revives dont disappear
- 36 zomnics a wave max
- melee does a stun
-
-
    - NORMAL 
- have armor system - armor breaks faster
- medium bot reaction time
- dont randomize array for hero buy, and perks
- player revives dissapear after 60 seconds
- 52 zomnics a wave max
- melee does not stun
-
    - HARD
- remove armor system
- fast bot reaction time
- do randomize array for hero buy, and perks
- player revives dissapear after 30 seconds
- scaling number of zomnics per wave? or just 72 max
- melee does not stun
-


include data compression for all arrays
include only 1 vector for all doors then use math to calculate the other 3 points

make a new trap on zones without bastion trap and make them use beam effects that electricute bots

Get rid of most if not all the workshop settings on line 660
No need for comment on line 719
Check if Easter egg name plates conflicts with line 739
Delete line 749
Compress data and loop in rule on line 753
Need for loop in rule on line 789
Not sure to change rule on line 1091
Is true for any in rule on line 1114
Is true for any in rule on line 1219
Use a for loop in rule on line 1326
Need to check if greater than 4 on line 134
Duplicate rule on line 1605

=== In eventhandling247

Need to check for if all players left do a soft restart, or if servers close to ending hard restart server early
Move the other "add points to late joined" rules as well to be here
Find any other "player joined" rules that are relevant 

===== Buynonfollower things
Does line 159 need hero radius variable?
Check for stability issues with rule on line 173
Remove or change perk on line 514
Error on price on line 535
Conflicting variable on line 568 and 572 and 577

===== Arrays
One of the follower mystery box locations is in a spawn room


==== Ammo system
For Hanzo you could wait until false when he is holding primary fire and is not holding secondary fire
On line 44 reins fire strike re enables?

==== Pack a punch 
Might be able to use data compression for lines 47 and 51



=========== Path to 1.0.0 =====================

get walls done 
- needs data compression and my own door designing tool done 
- optimize effects per zone, 1,2,3 atlest for doors, and maybe all effects
fix all playing elements to work 
get all zomnics balanced atleast ones for directors addition
- leave directors addition as default, then setting for brig and torb, and leave random (all hero) for a later update
leave easter egg for later update
